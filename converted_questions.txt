Intermediate goods are not included in GDP calculation to avoid double counting, as their value is already reflected in the final goods. GDP at market prices includes only final goods and services: private consumption, government spending, investments, and net exports.


Question 83:
Consider the following statements about money multiplier:
1. It is always greater than 1
2. It is inversely related to the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
3. It determines the maximum amount of money banks can create

Options:
  A. 1 and 2 only
  B. 2 and 3 only
  C. 1 and 3 only
  D. 1, 2 and 3

Answer: D
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Think about how CRR affects banks' ability to create credit and the relationship between initial deposits and total money creation.

Solution:
All statements are correct. The money multiplier is always greater than 1 as it represents the multiple of initial deposits that banks can create. It has an inverse relationship with CRR because a higher CRR reduces banks' ability to create credit. It determines the maximum money creation potential in the banking system.


Question 84:
In the context of the investment multiplier, which of the following statements is correct?

Options:
  A. A higher marginal propensity to save leads to a higher multiplier value
  B. The multiplier effect is strongest when there are no leakages in the economy
  C. The value of multiplier is independent of the marginal propensity to consume
  D. The multiplier effect works only in the short run

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider how leakages (savings, taxes, imports) affect the circulation of money in the economy.

Solution:
The multiplier effect is strongest when there are no leakages in the economy. Leakages like savings, taxes, and imports reduce the multiplier effect as they withdraw money from the circular flow of income. When there are fewer leakages, each rupee of investment generates more rounds of spending and income.


Question 85:
Which of the following would NOT be considered as capital receipts in the government budget?

Options:
  A. Recovery of loans given by government
  B. Disinvestment proceeds
  C. Corporate tax revenue
  D. Market borrowings

Answer: C
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Analyze the nature of different government receipts - whether they create future liabilities or assets.

Solution:
Corporate tax revenue is a revenue receipt, not a capital receipt. Capital receipts either create a liability (like borrowings) or reduce assets (like disinvestment). Tax revenues are regular income sources that neither create liability nor reduce assets.


Question 86:
Consider the following regarding Balance of Payments:
1. Current Account includes both visible and invisible trade
2. Foreign Direct Investment is recorded in Capital Account
3. SDR allocations are shown in Current Account

Options:
  A. 1 only
  B. 1 and 2 only
  C. 2 and 3 only
  D. 1, 2 and 3

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Think about the components of Current Account and Capital Account in Balance of Payments.

Solution:
Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Current Account includes both visible trade (goods) and invisible trade (services, income flows). FDI is recorded in Capital Account as it represents investment flows. SDR allocations are recorded in Capital Account, not Current Account, as they are financial items.


Question 87:
Which of the following would lead to an increase in the equilibrium level of income in an economy?

Options:
  A. Increase in marginal propensity to save
  B. Decrease in autonomous investment
  C. Increase in taxation
  D. Increase in government expenditure

Answer: D
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Consider how different factors affect aggregate demand and the multiplier process.

Solution:
An increase in government expenditure directly adds to aggregate demand and, through the multiplier process, leads to a higher equilibrium level of income. The other options would either reduce aggregate demand or weaken the multiplier effect, leading to lower equilibrium income.


Question 88:
India's GDP growth rate for FY 2023-24 is projected at 6.5%. If nominal GDP is expected to be ₹300 lakh crore and the base year is 2011-12, which of the following statements is correct?

Options:
  A. The economy is experiencing deflation
  B. Real GDP growth is higher than nominal GDP growth
  C. There is an inflation rate of approximately 4-5%
  D. Real and nominal GDP are equal

Answer: C
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider the relationship between real GDP growth, nominal GDP growth, and inflation rate.

Solution:
Since nominal GDP includes both real growth (6.5%) and inflation, and nominal GDP growth is around 10-11%, the difference (approximately 4-5%) represents inflation. This aligns with RBI's inflation targeting framework.


Question 89:
If RBI reduces repo rate from 6.5% to 6.25%, and simultaneously increases CRR from 4.5% to 4.75%, what would be the likely impact on money multiplier and money supply?

Options:
  A. Money multiplier increases, money supply decreases
  B. Money multiplier decreases, money supply may increase or decrease
  C. Money multiplier decreases, money supply definitely decreases
  D. Money multiplier increases, money supply definitely increases

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider the opposing effects of repo rate and CRR changes on money supply.

Solution:
Increase in CRR reduces money multiplier (1/CRR). Lower repo rate tends to increase money supply through increased lending. The net effect on money supply depends on which factor dominates, making option B correct.


Question 90:
Calculate the fiscal deficit if: Total expenditure = ₹40 lakh cr, Revenue receipts = ₹25 lakh cr, Recovery of loans = ₹2 lakh cr, Borrowings = ₹12 lakh cr, Other capital receipts = ₹1 lakh cr

Options:
  A. ₹12 lakh cr
  B. ₹13 lakh cr
  C. ₹15 lakh cr
  D. ₹14 lakh cr

Answer: C
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Fiscal deficit = Total expenditure - (Revenue receipts + Non-debt capital receipts)

Solution:
Non-debt capital receipts = Recovery of loans + Other capital receipts = 3 lakh cr. Total receipts excluding borrowing = 25 + 3 = 28 lakh cr. Fiscal deficit = 40 - 28 = 15 lakh cr


Question 91:
In an economy where C = 100 + 0.8Y, I = 500, G = 400, what would be the impact on equilibrium income if government increases spending by ₹100 cr while simultaneously increasing taxes by ₹100 cr?

Options:
  A. Increases by ₹500 cr
  B. Increases by ₹100 cr
  C. No change
  D. Increases by ₹400 cr

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider balanced budget multiplier concept.

Solution:
This is balanced budget multiplier scenario. When G increases by 100 and T increases by 100, the net effect is an increase in Y by 100 (balanced budget multiplier = 1). MPC doesn't affect this result.


Question 92:
India's forex reserves decreased from $642 billion to $590 billion in 2022. Which combination of factors likely contributed to this?

Options:
  A. Rising crude oil prices and appreciating rupee
  B. Increasing FDI and rising exports
  C. Rising crude oil prices and FPI outflows
  D. Increasing remittances and export growth

Answer: C
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Think about factors affecting forex demand and supply in 2022.

Solution:
Higher crude oil prices increased import bill and dollar demand. FPI outflows due to global monetary tightening led to dollar outflow. These factors reduced forex reserves despite stable exports and remittances.


Question 93:
If banking system's total deposits are ₹1000 cr, CRR is 4%, SLR is 18%, and actual reserves are ₹220 cr, calculate excess reserves.

Options:
  A. ₹40 cr
  B. ₹180 cr
  C. ₹60 cr
  D. ₹100 cr

Answer: A
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Calculate required reserves (CRR + SLR) and subtract from actual reserves.

Solution:
Required reserves = CRR (₹40 cr) + SLR (₹180 cr) = ₹220 cr. Actual reserves = ₹220 cr. Therefore, excess reserves = ₹220 cr - ₹180 cr = ₹40 cr


Question 94:
Consider: GDP(MP) = ₹2000 cr, NFIA = -₹50 cr, Net indirect taxes = ₹150 cr, Depreciation = ₹100 cr. Calculate NNP at factor cost.

Options:
  A. ₹1800 cr
  B. ₹1700 cr
  C. ₹1750 cr
  D. ₹1850 cr

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 3/5
Hint: Follow steps: GDP→GNP→NNP→NNP at factor cost

Solution:
GNP = GDP + NFIA = 2000 - 50 = 1950 cr, NNP = GNP - Depreciation = 1950 - 100 = 1850 cr, NNP at factor cost = NNP - Net indirect taxes = 1850 - 150 = 1700 cr


Question 95:
India's projected debt-to-GDP ratio for 2024 is 83%. If nominal GDP grows at 10% and fiscal deficit is 5.9% of GDP, what happens to debt-to-GDP ratio?

Options:
  A. Increases as fiscal deficit is positive
  B. Decreases due to higher nominal GDP growth
  C. Remains constant
  D. Cannot be determined without interest rate

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Compare nominal GDP growth rate with fiscal deficit.

Solution:
When nominal GDP growth (10%) exceeds fiscal deficit (5.9%), debt-to-GDP ratio typically decreases due to denominator growing faster than numerator, assuming constant interest rates.


Question 96:
If India's current account deficit is 2% of GDP and capital account surplus is 3% of GDP, what happens to exchange rate and forex reserves?

Options:
  A. Exchange rate depreciates, forex reserves decrease
  B. Exchange rate appreciates, forex reserves increase
  C. Exchange rate stable, forex reserves increase
  D. Cannot be determined without trade data

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Consider BOP identity and net forex inflow/outflow.

Solution:
Net capital inflow (3%) exceeds current account deficit (2%), creating net forex surplus of 1% of GDP. This leads to rupee appreciation pressure and increase in forex reserves.


Question 97:
In an economy with only consumption (C = 200 + 0.75Y) and investment (I = 800), if full employment income is 5000, calculate deflationary gap.

Options:
  A. ₹1000
  B. ₹200
  C. ₹800
  D. ₹400

Answer: D
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Calculate equilibrium income and compare with full employment income.

Solution:
Equilibrium: Y = C + I = (200 + 0.75Y) + 800, Y - 0.75Y = 1000, 0.25Y = 1000, Y = 4000. Deflationary gap = Full employment Y - Equilibrium Y = 5000 - 4600 = 400


Question 98:
India's digital payments volume through UPI reached 8,375 crore transactions in FY2022-23. If currency in circulation grows at 8% annually while digital payments grow at 50%, what impact is most likely on money multiplier?

Options:
  A. Decreases due to lower cash usage
  B. Increases due to higher velocity of money
  C. No impact as it depends only on CRR
  D. Increases due to lower cash-deposit ratio

Answer: D
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider how digital payments affect public's cash holding behavior.

Solution:
As digital payments increase, public holds less cash relative to deposits (lower cash-deposit ratio). This increases the money multiplier as more money stays in banking system. Money multiplier = 1/[CRR + cash-deposit ratio × (1-CRR)].


Question 99:
Consider RBI's recent retail CBDC (e₹) pilot. Which combination of factors would likely lead to its successful adoption?

Options:
  A. Higher interest rates on CBDC wallets and mandatory acceptance
  B. Integration with UPI and offline functionality
  C. Complete replacement of physical currency
  D. Restricting UPI transactions

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Think about India's existing digital payment ecosystem and infrastructure challenges.

Solution:
Success of CBDC depends on seamless integration with existing payment systems (UPI) and addressing infrastructure constraints through offline functionality. This ensures both convenience and accessibility, especially in rural areas.


Question 100:
India's exports are $450 billion, imports $650 billion, services surplus $150 billion, and remittances $100 billion. If FDI inflow is $40 billion and FPI inflow is $15 billion, calculate the balance of payments position.

Options:
  A. Surplus of $105 billion
  B. Deficit of $105 billion
  C. Balanced position
  D. Surplus of $55 billion

Answer: A
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider current account (trade + services + remittances) and capital account components.

Solution:
Current Account = (-200) + 150 + 100 = $50 billion, Capital Account = 40 + 15 = $55 billion. Total BoP = 50 + 55 = $105 billion surplus. This would increase forex reserves.


Question 101:
If India's nominal GDP is ₹300 lakh crore, tax-GDP ratio is 16%, and fiscal deficit target is 5.9%, calculate the maximum government expenditure possible while maintaining the deficit target.

Options:
  A. ₹65.7 lakh crore
  B. ₹48 lakh crore
  C. ₹71.7 lakh crore
  D. ₹53.7 lakh crore

Answer: A
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Use: Total expenditure = Tax revenue + Non-tax revenue + Borrowings (fiscal deficit)

Solution:
Tax revenue = 16% of 300 = ₹48 lakh cr, Fiscal deficit = 5.9% of 300 = ₹17.7 lakh cr. Assuming non-tax revenue of ₹3 lakh cr, Maximum expenditure = 48 + 17.7 = ₹65.7 lakh cr


Question 102:
India's sovereign green bonds yield is 7.25%, while regular government bonds yield 7.35%. Which policy objective does this yield difference primarily serve?

Options:
  A. Reducing fiscal deficit
  B. Promoting sustainable financing
  C. Controlling inflation
  D. Increasing tax revenue

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Consider the relationship between bond yields and investment priorities.

Solution:
Lower yields on green bonds (greenium) indicate government's policy push for sustainable financing by making it cheaper to fund green projects. This aligns with India's climate commitments and promotes environmental sustainability.


Question 103:
Calculate the impact on WPI inflation if crude oil price increases by 20%, assuming crude weight in WPI is 11% and pass-through coefficient is 0.6.

Options:
  A. 0.92%
  B. 1.32%
  C. 2.2%
  D. 1.52%

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Use formula: Impact = Price change × Weight × Pass-through coefficient

Solution:
Impact = 20% × 0.11 × 0.6 = 1.32%. This direct impact doesn't include secondary effects through transport costs and other inputs, which would further increase inflation.


Question 104:
If India's External Debt to GDP ratio is 20% and forex reserves cover 80% of external debt, what would be the impact of a 10% rupee depreciation?

Options:
  A. External debt rises by 2% of GDP
  B. Forex reserves value increases by 8% of GDP
  C. No impact as reserves provide adequate coverage
  D. External debt rises by 10% in rupee terms

Answer: A
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider the rupee value change of dollar-denominated debt and reserves.

Solution:
10% depreciation increases rupee value of external debt by 10% × 20% = 2% of GDP. While forex reserves value also increases, the net impact is negative as debt exceeds reserves.


Question 105:
In a growing economy, if GDP is ₹200 lakh crore, growth rate 7%, inflation 5%, and money velocity is 4, what should be the optimal money supply growth rate?

Options:
  A. 12%
  B. 7%
  C. 9%
  D. 14%

Answer: C
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Use quantity theory of money: MV = PY

Solution:
According to quantity theory, money supply growth = Real GDP growth + Inflation rate - Change in velocity. Assuming constant velocity, optimal money supply growth = 7% + 5% - 3% = 9%


Question 106:
India's installed renewable energy capacity reached 170 GW in 2023. If GDP elasticity of power demand is 0.8 and GDP grows at 6.5%, what additional renewable capacity is needed annually to maintain 50% renewable mix?

Options:
  A. 8.5 GW
  B. 10.2 GW
  C. 12.5 GW
  D. 15.3 GW

Answer: C
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Calculate power demand growth and required renewable addition.

Solution:
Power demand growth = GDP growth × elasticity = 6.5% × 0.8 = 5.2%. For 50% mix with base of 170 GW, annual addition needed = (170 × 0.052 × 2) = 12.5 GW


Question 107:
RBI introduces variable rate repo operations while maintaining repo rate at 6.5%. What is the primary objective?

Options:
  A. Reducing inflation
  B. Managing liquidity conditions
  C. Supporting government borrowing
  D. Promoting bank lending

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Think about the flexibility needed in liquidity management.

Solution:
Variable rate repos provide flexibility in managing liquidity without changing policy stance. This helps RBI fine-tune money market liquidity while maintaining overall monetary policy direction.


Question 108:
Which of the following actions by the RBI would most likely lead to contractionary monetary policy?

Options:
  A. Reduction in Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)
  B. Purchase of government securities in open market
  C. Increase in both CRR and repo rate
  D. Reduction in reverse repo rate

Answer: C
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider which combination of monetary policy tools would reduce money supply in the economy.

Solution:
Increasing both CRR and repo rate is contractionary as higher CRR reduces banks' lending capacity, while higher repo rate makes borrowing costly for banks. This combination effectively reduces money supply and credit creation in the economy.


Question 109:
Consider the following:
1. Depreciation
2. Net Indirect Taxes
3. Net Factor Income from Abroad
4. Subsidies
Which of these need to be added to GDP at factor cost to obtain GDP at market prices?

Options:
  A. 1 and 2 only
  B. 2 only
  C. 2 and 3 only
  D. 1, 2 and 3

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Think about the relationship between factor cost and market prices, and what constitutes indirect taxes.

Solution:
Only Net Indirect Taxes (indirect taxes minus subsidies) need to be added to GDP at factor cost to obtain GDP at market prices. Depreciation is already included in GDP, and Net Factor Income from Abroad is used to convert GDP to GNP.


Question 110:
In a flexible exchange rate system, if there is a sustained current account deficit, what would be its likely impact?

Options:
  A. Appreciation of domestic currency
  B. No change in exchange rate
  C. Depreciation of domestic currency
  D. Increase in foreign exchange reserves

Answer: C
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Consider how current account deficit affects the demand and supply of foreign exchange.

Solution:
A sustained current account deficit means continuous excess demand for foreign exchange to pay for imports. In a flexible exchange rate system, this excess demand leads to depreciation of domestic currency as more domestic currency is needed to buy the same amount of foreign exchange.


Question 111:
Which of the following combinations would most likely result in cost-push inflation?

Options:
  A. Increase in government spending and lower taxes
  B. Wage increases and rising raw material costs
  C. Higher consumer spending and business investment
  D. Reduction in interest rates and increased money supply

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 4/5
Hint: Distinguish between demand-pull and cost-push factors in inflation.

Solution:
Cost-push inflation occurs when production costs rise, pushing up prices even without an increase in demand. Wage increases and rising raw material costs directly increase production costs, leading to cost-push inflation. The other options describe demand-pull inflation scenarios.


Question 112:
Consider the following statements about fiscal deficit:
1. It represents the total borrowing requirements of the government
2. It can be financed through RBI's ways and means advances
3. Primary deficit is always less than fiscal deficit
4. It includes only capital expenditure of the government

Options:
  A. 1 and 2 only
  B. 1, 2 and 3 only
  C. 2, 3 and 4 only
  D. 1, 2, 3 and 4

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Analyze the components and financing of fiscal deficit, and its relationship with primary deficit.

Solution:
Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Fiscal deficit represents total borrowing requirements and can be financed through various means including RBI's ways and means advances. Primary deficit (fiscal deficit minus interest payments) is always less than fiscal deficit. Statement 4 is incorrect as fiscal deficit includes both revenue and capital expenditure.


Question 113:
In the context of Keynesian economics, if the economy is operating below full employment equilibrium, which of the following is most likely to occur?

Options:
  A. Increase in prices with no change in output
  B. Increase in output with stable prices
  C. Decrease in both output and employment
  D. Increase in unemployment with higher prices

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Think about Keynes's theory regarding the behavior of output and prices below full employment.

Solution:
According to Keynesian theory, when the economy operates below full employment, an increase in aggregate demand leads to increased output and employment with relatively stable prices. This is because excess capacity allows production to increase without significant price pressures.


Question 114:
According to the liquidity preference theory, which of the following would cause the money demand curve to shift rightward?

Options:
  A. Decrease in income level
  B. Increase in interest rates
  C. Increase in price level
  D. Decrease in expected inflation

Answer: C
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider factors affecting transaction, precautionary, and speculative demand for money.

Solution:
An increase in price level shifts the money demand curve rightward because more money is needed for the same volume of transactions (transaction demand). This represents an increase in nominal money demand due to higher prices, even if real money demand remains unchanged.


Question 115:
Consider the following scenarios:
1. India's forex reserves increase
2. RBI reduces repo rate
3. US Federal Reserve increases interest rates
4. Indian GDP growth rate exceeds 7%
Which combination would most likely lead to depreciation of the Indian Rupee?

Options:
  A. 1 and 4
  B. 2 and 3
  C. 3 and 4
  D. 1 and 2

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Analyze how monetary policy decisions in both countries affect capital flows and exchange rates.

Solution:
When RBI reduces repo rate (making Indian returns less attractive) and US Fed increases rates (making US returns more attractive), it leads to capital outflow from India to the US, causing rupee depreciation. This highlights the interconnectedness of global financial markets and interest rate differentials.


Question 116:
In the context of India's external sector, which of the following situations would most likely improve the Current Account Deficit (CAD)?

Options:
  A. Increase in crude oil prices with rising domestic consumption
  B. Rise in IT services exports and remittances from NRIs
  C. Higher gold imports due to festive season demand
  D. Increase in FDI inflows into manufacturing sector

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider both visible and invisible components of current account, and distinguish between current and capital account items.

Solution:
Rise in IT services exports (invisible exports) and remittances (current transfers) directly improve the current account balance. FDI inflows affect capital account, not current account. Higher oil prices and gold imports worsen CAD. This shows how service exports and remittances help offset merchandise trade deficit.


Question 117:
During a period of stagflation, if RBI prioritizes inflation control, which combination of policies would be most appropriate?

Options:
  A. Increase CRR and reduce government spending
  B. Reduce repo rate and increase money supply
  C. Maintain neutral stance on rates with targeted sector support
  D. Implement quantitative easing with fiscal expansion

Answer: A
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider the trade-off between controlling inflation and supporting growth during stagflation.

Solution:
During stagflation (high inflation with low growth), increasing CRR reduces money supply and raising interest rates controls inflation, while reduced government spending helps control demand-pull inflation. Though this might temporarily affect growth, controlling inflation becomes priority for long-term economic stability.


Question 118:
Which of the following best represents the concept of 'Twin Deficit' in Indian economy?
1. Fiscal deficit leading to current account deficit
2. Revenue deficit contributing to fiscal deficit
3. Trade deficit causing budget deficit
4. Primary deficit exceeding revenue deficit

Options:
  A. 1 only
  B. 2 only
  C. 1 and 2 only
  D. 3 and 4 only

Answer: A
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Analyze the relationship between government's fiscal position and external sector balance.

Solution:
Twin deficit refers to the phenomenon where fiscal deficit leads to current account deficit. When government increases borrowing (fiscal deficit), it can lead to higher imports and/or reduced export competitiveness through various channels like higher interest rates and appreciation of real exchange rate, thereby worsening current account deficit.


Question 119:
Consider the following about Special Drawing Rights (SDR):
1. They can be used directly for international trade
2. They serve as a supplement to existing reserve assets
3. Private entities can hold SDRs
4. Their value is based on a basket of major currencies

Options:
  A. 2 and 4 only
  B. 1, 2 and 3 only
  C. 1, 3 and 4 only
  D. 1, 2, 3 and 4

Answer: A
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Think about the nature and purpose of SDRs in the international monetary system.

Solution:
Only statements 2 and 4 are correct. SDRs supplement existing reserves and their value is based on a basket of currencies (USD, Euro, Yen, Pound Sterling, and Chinese Renminbi). They cannot be used directly for trade and can only be held by IMF member countries and authorized holders, not private entities.


Question 120:
If a country experiences 'jobless growth', which of the following could be potential causes?
1. Capital-intensive technological advancement
2. High labor productivity growth
3. Rigid labor markets
4. Focus on service sector-led growth

Options:
  A. 1 and 3 only
  B. 2 and 4 only
  C. 1, 3 and 4 only
  D. 1, 2, 3 and 4

Answer: D
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Analyze various structural and policy factors that can lead to GDP growth without proportional employment generation.

Solution:
All factors contribute to jobless growth. Capital-intensive technology reduces labor requirement, high productivity means fewer workers needed, rigid labor markets discourage hiring, and service sector growth often creates fewer jobs than manufacturing. This explains why high GDP growth might not translate into proportional employment growth.


Question 121:
In the context of monetary transmission mechanism, which of the following would strengthen the effectiveness of RBI's policy actions?
1. Well-developed government securities market
2. High proportion of fixed rate loans
3. Strong bank balance sheets
4. Limited informal sector

Options:
  A. 1 and 2 only
  B. 3 and 4 only
  C. 1, 2 and 3 only
  D. 1, 2, 3 and 4

Answer: D
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider factors that affect how monetary policy changes translate into real economy outcomes.

Solution:
All factors strengthen monetary transmission. A developed G-sec market helps in interest rate transmission, fixed rate loans ensure policy rate changes affect borrowing costs, strong bank balance sheets enable lending changes, and limited informal sector ensures wider reach of formal banking. This shows how structural factors affect policy effectiveness.


Question 122:
Consider the following statements about Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC):
1. It reduces the cost of currency management
2. It eliminates the need for CRR maintenance by banks
3. It can help in targeting delivery of government benefits
4. It increases monetary policy transmission efficiency

Options:
  A. 1 and 3 only
  B. 2 and 4 only
  C. 1, 3 and 4 only
  D. 1, 2, 3 and 4

Answer: C
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Think about how CBDC relates to traditional money supply and monetary policy mechanisms.

Solution:
Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. CBDC reduces physical currency management costs, enables direct benefit transfers, and improves monetary policy transmission through better tracking. Statement 2 is incorrect as banks still need CRR for maintaining financial stability and monetary control.


Question 123:
In the context of Green GDP calculation, which of the following would be correctly treated as economic activities?
1. Afforestation increasing carbon sink
2. Industrial production with pollution
3. Clean energy replacing fossil fuels
4. Mining natural resources

Options:
  A. 1 and 3 only
  B. 2 and 4 only
  C. 1, 2 and 4 only
  D. 1, 2, 3 and 4

Answer: D
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Consider how Green GDP accounts for both positive and negative environmental impacts in national income calculation.

Solution:
All activities are included in Green GDP but with adjustments. Afforestation and clean energy add positive value, while pollution and resource depletion are subtracted. This shows how Green GDP modifies traditional GDP to account for environmental sustainability.


Question 124:
Which of the following best represents the concept of 'competitive depreciation' in the context of international trade?
1. Strategic currency devaluation to boost exports
2. Natural depreciation due to market forces
3. Depreciation caused by capital outflows
4. Multiple countries simultaneously devaluing currencies

Options:
  A. 1 only
  B. 1 and 4 only
  C. 2 and 3 only
  D. 3 and 4 only

Answer: B
Difficulty Level: 5/5
Hint: Think about how countries might use exchange rates as a tool in international trade competition.

Solution:
Statements 1 and 4 describe competitive depreciation, where countries deliberately devalue currencies to gain export advantage, potentially leading to 'currency wars' if multiple countries do it simultaneously. This relates to exchange rate policy in open economy macroeconomics.


Question 125:
